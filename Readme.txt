To run this project first we need to setup Google Cloud Platform.
For Medico Web Application need Sublime text or visual Code.
We used dataset from kaggle     https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset
Lastly we have attached final dashboard from Looker Studio of Google Cloud Platform for reference.
